100YRS-frontend-styleguide
==========================

A starting point for frontend best practices.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to help make sense of the frontend development processes at A Hundred Years. This Styleguide is aimed at addressing the things that will come up during the course of every frontend project we do here. Most things are presented as suggestions, hence the term "Styleguide" vs. "Standard", which implies authoritative truth. Truth needs to exist in the specification, the tools we use should be the best possible solution for the problem at hand. Technology advances and so should our processes and tools. Help us make life easier by contributing to this repository and related Wiki pages, but specifcally help us all by writing brilliant, efficient and understandable code.
